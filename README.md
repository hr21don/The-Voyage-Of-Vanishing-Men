# The-Voyage-Of-Vanishing-Men
 Your goal is to write a Python function that determines the number of unique words in a text file, and counts how many times each word occurs. 
 
## Input
 It should accept the path to a text file as the input argument, and then print the total number of words in the file, as well as the top 20 most frequently used words and how many times each of them occurs. 

## Words Contain
We'll say that words can contain letters, numbers, apostrophes and hyphens, and they're separated by any other punctuation or white space. 

## Output
For e.g. 
*  from UniqueWords import unique_words
*  unique_words('StanleyMullen.txt')

Total Worlds: 743

Top 20 words:
AND 	 29
THE 	 29
A 	 26
WAS 	 15
TO 	 14
YOU 	 13
HE 	 12
OF 	 11
BRAUN 	 11
THERE 	 11
IN 	 11
ABOUT 	 11
IT 	 10
OUT 	 9
AS 	 9
I 	 8
HAD 	 7
INTO 	 7
TALK 	 6
ON 	 6
